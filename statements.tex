\textbf{\LARGE Statement of objective} 

In the year of 2013, I wrote a book named \textbf{Hadoop Operations and cluster management cookbook}. This writing experience is very rewarding in a few ways. One, it convinces myself that writing is not a thing that can only be done by writers. Two, it is an illustration of fruit from hard working, or in other words, if you are determined to work hard towards your goal, you will get there in the end. Three, it encourages my determination of continuing my writing career more objectively.

That being said, I want to improve my writing experience by first improving my past work in some way and creating a new writing project in another way. 

The objective of this writing plan is as following: 
\begin{enumerate} 
  \item Correct errors both technical and typographical. 
  \item Enrichment of the contents in the book, more specifically, add contents for Hadoop YARN. 
  \item Publish and share the writing experiences in some way. 
  \item Setting up the writing style along the way. 
\end{enumerate}
